# Bowling Score Calculator

By: Jesse Smith

This program solves the bowling scoring challenge. It is composed of two Python files:

bowling_sim.py <- A bowling simulator that creates random legal games of bowling, used for debugging.
bowling_game.py <- A bowling scoring program.

How to run:

These programs were written using Python 3.4.3 but any Python 3+ version should work with this code.

Simply run the program on the command line using this commmand:

python bowling_game.py

It will simulate a random game of bowling and score it by frame.
